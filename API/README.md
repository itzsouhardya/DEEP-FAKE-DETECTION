# 🎭 CHSAPI - Cavernous Hoax Scanner API 🔍
### A Project by WHITE LOTUS 🌸

## Introduction
Welcome to **CHSAPI**! Initially built for the **Cavernous Hoax Scanner** (CHS) project, our API has now evolved to serve a broader audience. It provides a suite of image utilities such as deepfake detection, image compression, format conversion, and more. Our API is crafted to help developers seamlessly integrate these tools into their applications, making it versatile and powerful for various real-world tasks.

## Features ✨
CHSAPI offers a variety of image-related functionalities:
1. **Deepfake Detection**: Scan images for potential deepfakes using machine learning.
2. **Image Compressor**: Compress images to reduce file size without compromising quality.
3. **Image Format Converter**: Convert images between different formats (e.g., PNG to JPEG).
4. **Image to PDF**: Convert image files into PDF format for easy sharing and storage.

## Why CHSAPI? 🌟
- **Adaptive & User-friendly**: Simple to integrate and use for various applications.
- **Fast & Efficient**: Built using **FastAPI** for speed and performance.
- **Machine Learning & Image Editing**: Our API leverages advanced machine learning concepts and image processing techniques to deliver high-precision results.
  
## Built With 💻
- **Python**: For the machine learning models and image processing tasks.
- **FastAPI**: Ensures a fast, async API that scales efficiently.
- **Hex Framework**: Provides structure and flexibility for creating modular code.
- **JPEN Stack**: Integration of **Node.js** and **Python**, where **Node.js** serves the back-end in the **CHS** project, and **Python** powers the back-end/API for **CHSAPI**.

## Who We Are? 🤝
**WHITE LOTUS** is the creative force behind CHSAPI. Our team members:
- **Krishnendu Mitra**: Lead Developer and Co-Creator of CHSAPI.
- **Saptarshi Pramanik**: Machine Learning Specialist and Co-Creator.

Together, we have built this **serverless API** to serve the community, and it is open for everyone to use **for free**.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Python**: Core language for building the API.
- **Node.js**: Powering the CHS frontend and interactions.
- **Machine Learning**: Used for deepfake detection and other advanced image tasks.

## How It Works 🛠️
1. **Send Requests**: Users can send their image files through HTTP requests.
2. **Processing**: Images are processed using Python-based machine learning models and image manipulation libraries.
3. **Results**: The results (whether deepfake detection, image compression, etc.) are returned quickly and efficiently.

## Get Started 🚀
To start using CHSAPI, simply integrate the API into your project with a few lines of code! Our documentation will guide you through every step, ensuring easy implementation.

## Advance Stack Technology 🖼️
![JPEN](https://kidKrishkode.github.io/Streamline-Diagnosis.github.io/images/jpen.png)
The JPEN stack is a technology stack that combines the power of JSON, Python, Embedded JavaScript, and Node.js. JSON (J) is used for level data interchange and storage, providing a lightweight and flexible format for data exchange. Python (P) is used for mechine learning scripting, offering a robust and versatile language for building machine learning empower web applications. Embedded JavaScript (E) allows for dynamic client-side scripting, enabling interactive user experiences. Finally, Node.js (N) provides the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side, enabling fast and scalable web development. Together, the JPEN stack enables developers to build scalable, and data driven or deep learning combined web applications.
